				<p>As meta as it may seem, I thought this very website could be a great case study on my approach to web design, as I was able to design it freely without the usual constraints that client work imposes.</p>

				<h2>The stack, or lack thereof</h2>
				<p>I started my journey humbly. It was 2008 and all I had xxxx was <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a> and a copy of "HTML & XHTML" by Dick Oliver. The results of my efforts were no less humble. An <code>index.html</code> file, <code>main.css</code>, sometimes a <code>main.js</code>, all sitting next to each other at the root of my project directory along with a folder of jpegs aptly named "imgs" (someone told me writing it that way saves bandwidth).</p>
				<p>There is a beauty, a zen to it.</p>

				<h2>The interactive document</h2>
				<p>The web was originally made to consult documents linked together through hypertext links, and as much as the underlying technology evolved and gained (too) many capabilities over the years, I still think that is what it is best at.</p>
				<p>It was a beautiful idea. A network of knowledges, weaved together through mutually beneficial threads. A never-ending book written by humanity for itself.</p>
				<p>Most actors of the industry these days consider web browsers as computers within computers, pushing for the oxymoronic paradigm of "web applications" so succesfully that the idea of native desktop programs is rapidly becoming obsolete for most non-technically minded people. There are however many things a web browser lacks compared to an operating system.</p>
				<p>For one, an operating system is resource efficient. That is its main job, and most of them do an acceptable job at it. For this reason, a program running natively on a desktop computer has direct access to the raw power of the computer. It's fast, lean, efficient.</p>
				<p>A web page is nothing like that. The new version of Reddit makes my laptop hot. That is in no way acceptable. Granted I don't use the most recent machine (a ThinkPad T480 running FreeBSD), but let me say that again. Reddit, a web page, uses more resources than all my other running processes, combined.</p>
				<p>An OS also comes with design rules. System-wide, consistent, coherent rules. Be it the system's graphical user interface toolkit, official design guidelines, or even "traditions", a native program "feels" native because it responds how we expect it to.</p>
				<p>Now a lack of design consistency is not a problem when dealing with documents. Every book in my home library uses different fonts, line tracking, and overall design systems, and apart from the lack of consistent spine title orientation, I'm surprisingly okay with it. The situation becomes more problematic the moment we try to </p>
				<p>A link looks like a link. Middle clicking something does what you think it does. You can use arrow keys to scroll the page... Basic stuff really.</p>
