				<p>Plantasia is an interior plants simulation game I'm currently developing as a side project. The player can take care of their plants in their virtual indoor garden and see them grow and flower, pick new plants in the wild, and hybridize them to create new varieties. The player gets to meet the characters populating the city of Plantasia along the way and discover their stories.</p>
				<p>While I had the idea for the game for years, I have only been working on it since August 2022. I am currently responsible for every aspect of the game. This includes the game design, programming, 3D modeling and animation, dialogue writing, sound design and soundtrack composition. I hope to get some funding and hire people to help me on some of those tasks. With proper funding the game could come out around September 2023.</p>

				<p>The game takes place in the city of Plantasia. The player can walk around the city to meet the other citizens and get quests from them to aquire new equipment, or collect new plants for their indoor garden. The main part of the game however takes place in the player's house. There, the player can care for their collection of plants and interact with them.</p>
				<p>The day-to-day maintenance of the plants consists of watering them at a given interval, cutting dead branches and leaves, and collecting seeds from plants that entered their flowering phase. The plants will keep growing when the player leaves the game. As the game’s main goal is to provide a relaxing experience to the player, the maintenance of the plants will be easy and forgiving (for example, if a player doesnt open the game for a whole week and comes back, a neighbour might have come and watered the plants for them and left a friendly note about it), and the player will quickly unlock tools to automatize the plant’s maintenance.</p>
				<p class="order-3">A number of alternative ways to interact with the plants will progressively be introduced to the player during their playthrough, for example making music with them.</p>

				<p>Music is an important aspect of the game. It will be possible to make generative music with the plants with the help of the Plant Synth, an equipment the player unlocks in a late quest in the game. Once aquired, the synth can be plugged into up to three plants and generate music algorithmically, creating an ambient musical tapestry unique to the player's plants.</p>
				<p class="order-3">As well as determining their visual aspects, the plant's genetic properties will also dictate their sonic identity: their tone, octave, or rhytmic pattern. It makes it possible for the musically neophyte player to compose music in an empirical way through the cross breeding of their best sounding plants. A musical artificial selection of sort.</p>

				<p>The game uses a method called L-Systems as a way to simulate plant growth algorithmically. Invented by Hungarian biologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristid_Lindenmayer" target="_blank">Aristid Lindenmayer</a>, L-Systems are a simple way to describe cyclical organic growth as a series of characters and a set of rewriting rules.</p>
				<p class="order-3">This gives Plantasia a somewhat realistic plant simulation engine. The virtual plants grow in patterns similar to real plants, and react to environmental conditions like light level or climate, and change their growing behaviour according to the player's pruning.</p>

				<p>I made this video introduction to L-Systems as a pilot for the game's Youtube devlog, but ended up not publishing it as it seemed too dry and technical a subject to introduce the game to an audience. I am currently working on a shorter format series of videos to introduce the world to Plantasia and hopefully create some following around it.</p>

				<p>After some underwhelming experiences with a few different game engines, I decided to develop the game entirely in C with the RayLib library taking care of the low-level stuff like 3D rendering and input handling.</p>
				<p>I developed many custom tools to help with the development such as map or dialogue editors. One of the most useful one, pictured here, is the "Plant Lab". It is basically the plant simulation part of the game, isolated as a standalone program. It allows me to experiment on the plant mechanics and the growing algorithms, and test ideas while I write the game design document.</p>
